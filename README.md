# Open Science Desktop

**Local-first, model-agnostic AI research workbench for macOS, Windows & Linux.**

Formerly Open Science. An open-source desktop alternative to Claude Science and
similar AI-for-science workbenches — built with Tauri, MCP, agent skills, and
reproducible artifacts. It connects agents, notebooks, files, figures, reports,
runs, and review into one auditable desktop workflow.

## What it does

**Runs the whole research loop** — from a broad direction to a finished paper:
exploration, literature survey, hypothesis, experiment code, analysis, figures, and
write-up, in one continuous, auditable session.

- **Autonomous research agents** — the bundled `ai4s-agent` chains specialist skills
  end to end (explore → survey → experiment → write), and each stage drops a real,
  inspectable artifact into your workspace, not just a chat reply.
- **Everything traces back** — figures, tables, reports, notebooks, and run outputs
  link to the exact code, inputs, environment, model output, and conversation that
  produced them.
- **Local-first and yours** — sessions, data, provenance, notebooks, and run records
  live in local folders on your machine. Nothing leaves by default.
- **Model-agnostic runtime** — the UI talks through `packages/sdk` to a bundled,
  pinned OpenCode sidecar. Bring your own model; providers, skills, and MCP servers
  stay pluggable.
- **Reproducible by construction** — local, SSH/Slurm, Modal, and notebook-batch runs
  are captured as reproducible run records, not loose terminal scrollback.
- **Reach it from anywhere** — a built-in, token-authenticated gateway serves the
  *real* desktop UI to a browser on your LAN or phone (or, with a tunnel, from
  anywhere) — kick off a run at your desk and check on it from your phone over lunch.
  Off by default; loopback-only until you opt in, and API keys never leave the machine.
- **Drives your own browser** — the agent can control your real Chrome, with your
  profile and logins intact, to read the live web the way you do — or an isolated
  private browser when you'd rather it not.
- **Plan before it acts** — `/plan` lays out an execution plan before touching a
  file, and `/goal` fixes the objective, constraints, and acceptance criteria the
  agent then works toward.
- **Built for long projects** — named projects group their sessions, two layers of
  persistent memory (global and per-project) carry what matters between them, and a
  long conversation compacts itself as it approaches the model's context window.
- **Work several threads at once** — tile panes side by side, keep independent
  Screens, and give each pane its own model.
- **Extensible** — agent skills, MCP servers and one-click science connectors,
  `/` commands, `!` shell mode, and a model-agnostic SDK.

## See it in action

**One prompt -> a publication-grade figure, and every point traces to the exact code
and inputs that made it.** No black boxes: open any artifact to see its generating
script, its data files, and the conversation that produced it.

**Literature -> a verifiable report.** Fan the search out across sources, draft a
manuscript rendered as a PDF, and gate it on a citation review — DOIs resolved,
unsourced numbers and figure/code inconsistencies flagged — before anything ships.

**Drives your own Chrome.** The agent reads the live web through your real browser
profile — logins and all — then turns what it finds into a figure and a sortable CSV.

**Research from anywhere — even your phone.** A built-in authenticated gateway serves
the *real* desktop UI to a browser on your LAN (or a tunnel), so you can kick off a run
at your desk and read the finished figure and report on your phone.

## Current capabilities

**The research loop, as skills.** One meta-skill runs the full pipeline; each stage
is a self-contained skill that produces a real, gradeable artifact — runnable on any
model OpenCode supports:

| Skill | Role | Primary output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ai4s-agent` | Runs the four skills below, in order | The full research package |
| `research-explorer` | Turn a broad direction into concrete topics | `research_exploration.md`, `topic_matrix.md`, `literature_pre_survey.md` |
| `literature-survey` | Write a literature survey | 6–20 pp PDF, 60+ real citations, LaTeX source, taxonomy figures |
| `experiment-suite` | Build an experiment package | Design doc, runnable code, `results.json` with provenance, figures, report |
| `paper-writer` | Write a research paper | 8–14 pp PDF, 200+ citations, 4–8 figures, tables |
| `mindmap-render` | Render a mindmap | Image generated from a `topic_matrix.md` |
| `integrity-auditor` | Audit a paper's integrity | Image / numerical / logical findings, 4-level evidence grading, `audit_report.md` |

These ship in the `ai4s-skills` pack alongside first-party review skills and the
office/document skills below.

### Platform

| Area | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop shell | Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Vite, with macOS, Windows, and Linux desktop builds. |
| Runtime | Bundled OpenCode sidecar, auto-started by the app, isolated from the user's own OpenCode config/data. |
| Projects | Named project workspaces that group their sessions; import an existing folder in place (never copied) or adopt one already inside the workspace; move an existing session into a project. |
| Sessions | Multi-session chat/history, dated workspace folders, searchable history with archive/restore/export, `@` file and `#` conversation references, `/` commands, and `!` shell mode. |
| Layout | N-ary split-pane tiling with drag-to-dock, independent Screens, per-pane model and reasoning effort, and cross-screen pane drag. |
| Agent modes | `/plan` for plan-then-execute, `/goal` for objective and acceptance criteria, live subagent status in its own panel, and Stop that reflects the runtime's real server state. |
| Memory | Global and per-project memory layers, switchable, plus automatic context compaction as a conversation approaches the model's window. |
| Remote compute | Register machines from your `~/.ssh/config`, probe them, and submit, track, or cancel jobs from the app. |
| Appearance | Light, Warm, and Dark themes with per-theme accents, and UI zoom. |
| Files | Global and per-session file browsing, context menu actions, external open/reveal, copy path, and local preview server. |
| Remote access | Token-authenticated gateway that serves the real UI to a CLI, a LAN web browser, or your phone (loopback by default, LAN opt-in); read-only vs full access modes; copy a link with the token embedded to connect in one tap. API keys never cross the wire. |
| Browser control | The agent drives your own Chrome — profile and login state preserved — reading pages through the accessibility tree, or an isolated/private browser on demand. |
| Notebooks | Real `.ipynb` files, Python and R notebook creation, local kernel execution, managed Jupyter environment via bundled `uv`, and an Open JupyterLab action. |
| Runs | Append-only run logs, global SQLite run index, search/facets/pagination, local/remote surfaces, output links, logs, and reproduce prompts. |
| Provenance | `.openscience/provenance.jsonl` tracks file versions and links produced artifacts back to the run or edit that created them. |
| Review | Traceability, statistics-integrity, domain-check, large-file, publication-figure, remote-compute, and Modal run skills are bundled as first-party skills. |
| Viewers | PDF, image, video, HTML, Markdown, code, CSV/TSV tables with charts, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, molecules, 3D meshes, genome tracks, FITS, DOS/DOSCAR, EIGENVAL bands, qcode, anomaly maps, and phase files. |
| Models | OpenCode provider catalog, OAuth/API-key provider flows, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and local/provider-specific options supported by OpenCode. |
| Interface languages | English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, and Korean. Portuguese (Brazil) and Arabic are registered but not selectable yet. |

## Skills and connectors

Bundled skills are fetched for builds and releases instead of being committed into
git history:

- `ai4s-skills` pack from `ai4s-research/ai4s-skills`.
- Office/document skills from the Apache-2.0 `anthropics/skills` repository:
  `docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, and `xlsx`.
- First-party core skills in `runtime/skills/core/`:
  `traceability-review`, `stats-integrity`, `domain-check`, `large-file`,
  `publication-figures`, `remote-compute`, and `modal-run`.

One-click science MCP connectors currently include:

- Literature search: arXiv, PubMed, Crossref, Semantic Scholar, bioRxiv/medRxiv.
- Biomedical databases: PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, MyVariant/ClinVar.
- Materials Project.
- FRED economic data.
- Space weather.
- Open-Meteo weather and climate.
- USGS water data.

You can also add any local or remote MCP server from Settings. See
[`docs/CONNECT_YOUR_TOOLS.md`](./docs/CONNECT_YOUR_TOOLS.md).

For a neutral positioning note, see
[`Open Science Desktop vs OpenScience`](./docs/open-science-desktop-vs-openscience.md).

## Install

Download the latest installer from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/ai4s-research/open-science/releases/latest).

- **macOS**: `.dmg` / `.app`, Apple Silicon and Intel, macOS 13 Ventura or later.
- **Windows**: NSIS `.exe` and `.msi`, Windows 10/11 x64.
- **Linux**: `.deb` and `.rpm` on x86_64 Linux.

The macOS packages are Developer ID signed, notarized, and stapled, so they open
normally — no `xattr` workaround needed. Windows and Linux builds are not signed yet.

**Windows**: if SmartScreen appears, choose **More info -> Run anyway**.

**Linux**:

```bash
sudo apt install ./Open.Science_*.deb
# or
sudo rpm -i Open.Science-*.rpm
```

## Build from source

Prerequisites:

- Node.js >= 20
- pnpm 9
- Rust toolchain
- macOS, Windows, or Linux system dependencies required by Tauri

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai4s-research/open-science
cd open-science
pnpm install

# Fetch pinned sidecars and bundled skills. These are git-ignored.
bash scripts/dev/fetch-opencode.sh
bash scripts/dev/fetch-uv.sh
bash scripts/dev/fetch-skills.sh

# Run in development or build installers.
pnpm --filter @ai4s/desktop tauri dev
pnpm --filter @ai4s/desktop tauri build
```

Useful checks:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
```

## Safety and privacy

- Workspace files, raw data, session history, provenance, notebooks, and run records
  stay local by default.
- Command execution, file deletion, dependency installation, and remote connections
  are human-approved flows in the desktop app.
- Provider credentials are written to app-private runtime config, not to the
  workspace, provenance, git, exports, or global OpenCode config.
- Settings includes a plain-language data-flow view explaining what can be sent to
  the selected model provider.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/desktop/` | Tauri + React desktop app. |
| `packages/sdk/` | `OpenCodeClient`; keeps the UI from calling OpenCode directly. |
| `packages/shared/` | Shared domain types and chart palette. |
| `packages/ui/` | Shared UI package. |
| `runtime/skills/core/` | First-party scientific skills. |
| `runtime/skills/external/` | Build-fetched external skills. |
| `runtime/harness/` | Runtime harness knowledge and operator context. |
| `runtime/mcp/` | MCP runtime notes/configuration. |
| `examples/` | Built-in example workspaces. |
| `scripts/dev/` | Sidecar, `uv`, skill fetchers, and focused regression probes. |
| `docs/` | Product, technical, operator, connector, and research notes. |

## Status

The project is a working desktop MVP in active development. The most reliable current
implementation log is [`PROGRESS.md`](./PROGRESS.md). Product and architecture notes
live in [`docs/PRD.md`](./docs/PRD.md) and
[`docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`](./docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md), but those documents include
target design as well as historical status notes.

Near-term work is focused on Windows code signing, auto-update, broader
Windows/Linux verification, richer connector hardening, and continued
reproducibility review. macOS releases are already signed and notarized.
